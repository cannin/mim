    <h3>Creating MIM diagrams</h3>

    <p><b><i>Pathvisio has recently added the feature to create MIM diagrams. We
    encourage users to provide us their comments, questions, and feedback.</i></b></p>

    <p>An introduction to the MIM notation is provided in the 2006 publication: <a href=
    "http://www.molbiolcell.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/1/1">Molecular Interaction Maps
    of Bioregulatory Networks: A General Rubric for Systems Biology.</a> There are
    currently several efforts to provide tools for the creation of MIM diagrams. One
    current tool, <a href="http://www.pathvisio.org/Main_Page">Pathvisio</a>, provides
    functionality for creating and exporting MIM diagrams into several different formats.
    A manual on its usage is provided <a href=
    "http://www.pathvisio.org/Help_1.1">here.</a></p>Click here to <a href=
    "http://www.pathvisio.org/Download">download Pathvisio.</a>

    <p>This tool is a general pathway drawing tool that includes many MIM specific
    features. If you wish to create MIM specific diagrams, you will have to be selective
    in your choice of images. In the creation of interactions between species users can
    specify MIM interaction symbols as the start or end line types, these all begin with
    'mim-'. This feature is located in the properties tab on the right-hand side of the
    editor.</p><img src="img/pathvisio.png"
