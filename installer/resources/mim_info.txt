A Pathvisio plugin that supports drawing diagrams using the Molecular 
Interaction Map (MIM) notation. Major features include the addition of a panel 
providing MIM-specific glyphs and support for the MIMML file format which can be 
used for exchange diagrams with other MIM-compatible tools. Users have the 
ability to annotate diagram elements with comments, literature references, and 
links to external databases.
